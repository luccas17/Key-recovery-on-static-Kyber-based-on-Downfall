### kyber_attacks
Shows the code used for the victims in the final attacks. Compiled versions of these are used in the final attack. 

### ProjectCode 
Contains code both for Downfall experiments aswell as the compiled final attack against Kyber 

### Running the code 
Most folders have a couple of shellscripts named attack.sh and victim.sh. These contain the commands we used to run our experiments, first starting a victim, then an attacker afterwards. We observed better performance when running the commands directly, instead of using the shellscripts, but either works.
